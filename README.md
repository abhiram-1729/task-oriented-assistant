Limitations & Future Improvements
Current Limitations
⚠️ Web search functionality is basic (uses Google search scraping)

⚠️ No persistent storage between sessions (memory resets)

⚠️ Learning style detection relies on keyword matching

⚠️ Limited to text-based goals and planning

Planned Improvements
Persistent storage with database integration

Advanced web search with proper API integration

Multi-format goal input (voice, image analysis)

Collaborative planning features

Export plans to PDF/calendar formats

Advanced progress analytics with charts

Integration with productivity tools

Troubleshooting
Issue: "GEMINI_API_KEY not found in .env file"
Solution: Ensure your .env file has GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here and is in the same directory as app.py

Issue: "Please set GEMINI_API_KEY in your .env file"
Solution: Create a .env file in the project root with your valid Gemini API key

Issue: Web search not returning results
Solution: This may be due to Google blocking automated requests. Consider implementing a proper search API

Issue: Streamlit app not loading
Solution: Ensure all dependencies are installed and port 8501 is available

Security Considerations 🔒
API Key Safety

Never commit .env to version control

Always use .gitignore to exclude .env

Rotate your API key regularly

Use environment variables in production deployments

API Costs
Gemini 2.0 Flash: Free tier available (limited requests)

Web Research: Free (basic Google search scraping)
